# EbedCustomerSupport

## Creating a new issue

This project is used to track customer support issues related to Ebed Technologies software products.

To generate a new issue, click on the `Issues` tab, then on `New issue`. Fill in the form, describing your issue
to the best of your ability. Please include any attachments that will help us understand your issue. 

Before submitting, tag the issue with two labels. One label should be a `type:` label defining whether this is
a bug, a feature request, or a question. The second label should be a `product:` label identifying which of
our products you are writing about.

## Watching issues

You will automatically be notified of any changes related to the issues that you create. However, you are
not limited to those. You may also search for other issues that are of interest to you and watch them
by pressing the `Watch` button at the top of the page. You will then receive any notifications related
to that issue.

## Some guidelines

* Note that this is a public site, so don't write anything that you are not willing for others to see.
* Avoid profanity, insultes and other such language.
* Describe your issue briefly, but include as much information as you think we will need.
